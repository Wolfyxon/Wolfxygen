# Wolfxygen
A Minecraft plugin that requires players to breathe in specific worlds.  
Supports all versions above `1.16`
### Dedication
I was requested to make this plugin for an upcoming server called **Nuclear Swamp**.

## Configuration
Default config can be found [here](https://github.com/Wolfyxon/Wolfxygen/blob/spigot/src/main/resources/config.yml)  
Configuration usage is explained in the file.  
The config is located in `/path/to/your/server/plugins/Wolfxygen/config.yml` (you must start the server or reload it once for the config to appear)  
All text values support color formatting (see https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/color_list_pc.php).  
`&` is used for the color instead of `ยง`, example `&4`
